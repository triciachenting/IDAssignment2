# IDAssignment2
repo for assignment 2

For the html, the basic content information is shown, with a title, a quote, an author and a 'get new quote' button. The html uses several different classes connected to the css to style the different parts of the website. The website is simple and only contains one div.

For the css, i have styled the body and the div separately. For the different parts of the content, they are styled differently to show the difference among one another. I have added a hover and an enlarging effect for the 'get new quote' button for the user to know that it is a button and not a random text in a box.
